							<h2 style="color:#005a8a">About Me</h2>
						<p>I’m based in Brisbane and just starting out in IT with study at RMIT this year. I haven’t completed any other tertiary study, so my last time studying was Year 12 back in 2013. I’m terrible at hobbies, but I like board games, Netflix and playing around with computers.</p>
					</section>

						<h2 style="color:#005a8a">Interest in IT</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<p> <b> What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</b> </p>
							<p><i>I haven’t got any formal IT experience, but I’ve had an interest in IT for as long as I can remember. I think what sparked my initial interest was solving problems for people on their computers. My mum, for instance, would often have some sort of issue she couldn’t figure out, and even though I also had no idea how to fix that problem she would ask me to help. Through trial and error, I could generally solve the problem, and in the process, I had grown my understanding of how a certain system or concept worked. I am constantly doing the same thing today, trying something new, learning from it and building a deeper understanding of the various systems that make up the digital world we live in today. I really enjoy it, and I’m excited to explore it on a higher level through this course.</i> </p>
							<p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </b></p>
							<p> <i> I specifically wanted to study online so I had the flexibility to pursue work and other endeavours while I was studying. Through research of multiple universities offering similar course I decided upon RMIT. From student testimonies and perusal of their course guide, RMIT had exactly what I was looking for. The course covers a wide-ranging number of courses and allows a large degree of flexibility in how you wish to specialise the degree. As I haven’t yet decided exactly which career path I wish to pursue, this approach allows me the time to explore, while still ensuring the degree provides high level specialisations for later down the track. </i> </p>
 							<p> <b> What do you expect to learn during your studies? </b> </p>
 							<p> <i>  IT is such a broad topic, so I’m expecting that I’ll receive a high-level understanding of how deeply ingrained it has become today in today’s world. Programming/coding will be a major focus I believe and are an important part of the core of IT. Database concepts and web programming are two other topics that will be touched on. As the study progresses and my core knowledge is expanded, I’ll be able to specialize into some of the elective options RMIT offers. At this stage I’m leaning towards options like Cloud Computing and further programming in different languages. </i>

						<h3> <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/41167687?type=standard#searchRequestToken=907fab4a-d231-4bba-8267-e76c1de5f253"> Android Programmer for Gold Coast based IoT Product Development Company </a> <a href="images/job.png"> [PIC] </a> </h2>
						<p>This position is for an IT product development company that specialises in IoT in consumer level markets. The role would involve developing software for android to interact with low energy Bluetooth and other wireless technologies. This would be within home automation and also utilise Google could services. The role appeals to me as it has a focus on integrating software with the real world in new ways and will allow me to explore further opportunities within the sector. IoT something I’m very interested to explore as it becomes more and more common in the years to come.</p>
						<p>The position specifies that a successful candidate may not have a large amount of industry experience but will be able demonstrate interest and ability. The focus is a requirement to design and build applications utilising Android, and an understanding of the basic guidelines and principles for developing on the Android platform. Understanding of object-oriented programming and cloud services and architecture are required are also required. Experience in cloud-based services is mentioned, specifically within the google cloud platform. Hands on-experience in these industries is generally required.</p>
						<p>I am a fast learner, and meticulous with detail. I have good written and oral communication skills and I am very self-motivated. I currently have no IT experience and very limited programming proficiency. I have good written and oral communication skills from some of my previous jobs. Although I meet some of the requirements for this job, I lack experience and understanding of most of the programming and technical requirements. I would not currently qualify for this job.</p>
						<p>I plan to develop most of these skills through my study at RMIT, through both core subjects early on, and electives. I would need to specialise my studies in programming, specifically for mobile, as well as cloud computing and IoT/hardware subjects. Specifically, I would study Cloud computing and further programming as electives in future periods. On top of that as my proficiency increases in these areas, I’ll have the ability to pursue jobs in the IoT or android sector, to hone my skills and gain important experience. Getting hands on experience in the field would be an important step in securing this job.</p>

				<p><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </b></p>
				<p> <i> I think that these results really highlight a lot of my unique strengths and allow me to be aware of some of my weaknesses in different aspects of both personal and professional life. 16 Personalities’ Myer-Briggs test identifies some of the strengths the INTP personality as great analysts and abstract thinkers, open minded and objective. Specifically, within the IT industry, these qualities are extremely valuable in overcoming obstacles, and remaining focused on the goal at hand. Being a visual learner is something that really melds quite well with online study, as the vast majority of the study materials are on screen.</i> </p>
				<p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </b></p>
				<p><i>I’m not the most social person, as my results indicate, so it’s something I’ll need to focus on in a team environment. I think my higher indicators of curiosity and abstract creativity, which are also evidenced in the Myer-Briggs test, will provide a great benefit to problem solving and finding unique solutions for a team. I could have the tendency to not engage as much as I should in team discussions, so that will be a focus for me.  </i></p>
				<p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?  </b></p>
				<p> <i> I should make sure I’m aware of my flaws and keep communication open with prospective team members. It would probably not ideal to have too many of the same personality types in a single group, so ensuring we have a diverse team will be something to consider. A more diverse team allows for a different ideas and ways of looking at things, which is a strength. Having a variety of creative strengths would also provide a benefit, as again it enables different points of view, and outside the box solutions.</i></p>

						<h2 style="color:#005a8a"> Project Idea </h2>
						<h4>Overview </h4>
						<p>Weather is still not entirely predictable, but there are newly emerging technologies that can help us gain a better understanding. 5G and IoT devices open an entirely new realm of possibilities for how we collect weather data, and how it is processed. Utilising low powered connected devices, the sheer amount of data that could be collected would alter how we model weather entirely. This would allow new insights into microclimates and a deeper understanding of how each system affects others. A more granular system of collection ensures higher accuracy and more advance modelling and forecasting for localised areas.</p>
						<h4>Motivation </h4>
						<p>In Australia, the forecasts and observations are collected and determined using a network of weather stations. (Burea of Meterorlogy, 2018) This model provides an understanding of the macro effects of weather over the country but can neglect the localised factors that play a part in the system. Trees, buildings, hills and other structures influence the observations recorded. (Bureau of Meteorology, n.d) Increasing the number of sites from which data is collected would allow for a deeper understanding of this phenomenon and a more accurate model. Advances in connectivity through technologies like 5G, and the increasing availability of low cost connected devices allow a change in the way we collect and utilise weather data.</p>
						<h4>Description </h4>
						<p>The bulk of weather data collected in Australia consists of air pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and rainfall. This data is used to model weather and provide forecasts. The method in which this data is modelled uses large grids. ‘The size of the grids is limited by the data density across Australia’ (Bureau of Meteorology, 2009) With the uprising of 5G technologies, combined with the increasing range of IoT devices a solution can be developed that results in more granular data.  The aim is to reduce the size of these grids and gain an understanding of the microclimates of local areas.
							<br/><br/>Increasing the number of sensors utilised could be achieved in several ways. Opening the opportunity for consumers to participate in the collection would be an ideal solution for increasing accuracy in suburban areas. It could also be done on a private basis, or in conjunction with specific companies. The agriculture sector for instance, would benefit greatly from the ability to see a real time model of the conditions affecting their crops. Both natural and artificial structures such as hills, building and trees affect the microclimate (MetLink, n.d), and these insights could be invaluable to better implementing informed actions in industries where climate is a factor. A combination of these two options would be the ideal approach as it would allow increased uptake, and thus, more data for modelling.
							<br/><br/>A similar model of this would be that of Flightradar24.  They offer the ability for regular consumers to assist in mapping flights, and then process user collected data, in conjunction with both privately collected data and official data. (Flightradar24, n.d)   There are several home weather devices on the market already today, however accuracy is important. Ensuring the sensors used meet the requirements of WMO, World Meteorological Organisation, will mean the results are highly accurate. The option of allowing consumers to build their own weather station using Raspberry Pi or Arduino could also be explored, providing there are clear guidelines.  The sensors are currently still quite expensive, which may be a drawback in initial user uptake, and corporate integration.
							<br/><br/>For connectivity, Wi-Fi or low energy Bluetooth will need to be installed in each sensor system. The exact technologies used form uploading the data would likely vary, dependant on their implemented technology locally. Technology like 5G will allow seamless connectivity to a huge number of sensors through the ability to offer low power connected solutions. (Qualcomm, n.d) In more rural areas however, cable or satellite options may need to be implemented. The project would likely be implemented mostly in places where internet connectivity will already be in place and existing technology can be used.
							<br/><br/>The collected data would be received in real time, or short intervals, to ensure the model is constantly updated. The back end of the software would utilize powerful cloud-based processing and require a complex metrological algorithm and data base to be built into it. A front-end system for viewing the processed data would need to be created showcasing current observations and forecasts.
						</p>
						<h4>Tools and technologies </h4>
						<p>The major focus for this project would be building a platform that can collect and collate the data in real time, from the vast array of sensors in place. Existing technology for collecting weather data can be utilised as well as building new connected devices using Raspberry Pi or Arduino and high-quality sensors. Utilising official data from entities such as BoM, NOAA and ECMWF, will allow the data collected to be crosschecked, and increase the scale of the model. A powerful processing algorithm and database will need to be created to provide will provide both up to date observations of the weather, but also forecasts in real time.</p>
						<h4>Skills required</h4>
						<p>An understanding of weather modelling, or access to resources offering an advanced understanding will be needed. Cloud services will also have to be utilised to process the data in a centralised location. A comprehensive weather modelling algorithm will need to be created and implemented into this cloud system. A frontend system will also be required to be developed to allow uploading of weather data, likely a website and installed app. There are plenty of developers with this skillset, however converting meteorological concepts to an algorithm may limit the options for back-end. Hardware is also readily available but may be currently cost prohibitive to some people or industries. </p>
						<h4>Outcome </h4>
						<p>If this project was successful, the outcome would be a deeper understanding of how microclimates affect the macro climate. This insight could prove valuable to several climate reliant industries such as farming. Beyond that the insights could be utilised by plenty of fields of science to further examine how climate and weather play a role in their field of study. Everyday consumers will have access to accurate localised weather observations and forecasting that will more closely resemble their real conditions.</p>
